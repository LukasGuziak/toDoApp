# toDoApp

Hi everyone!
I am currently working on a ToDo application written in TypeScript. I am writing it because I want to use it when planning other projects and also practice TypeScript. It will be available soon on the [test server](https://lukasdevtest.tech).
I am starting the project on November 14, 2022.
